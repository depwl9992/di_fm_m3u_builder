DI.fm m3u Builder
A small utility to build an m3u playlist from any set of Digitally Imported internet radio channels.
Written by Daniel Powell in Embarcadero C++ Builder XE3.
Unless translated, various VCL libraries are required to rebuild on other systems.

Features:
* Configure any set of bandwidths (4 available in Premium). This is playlist-wide - selected set of bandwidths will be written for all selected channels.
* Configure station URLs hosted on 8 redundant, mirrored servers (configurable), or simply link to the hosted .pls file preconfigured with their preferred servers.
* Playlist-vs-Server URLs are persistent between sessions via .ini file.
* Premium account is required on http://www.di.fm. A 24-byte listen key will be generated which is entered in the application and stored between sessions in the ini file.
* Channel list (key=value formatting) is loaded on startup from channels.txt in the program directory. Selecting a channel from the dropdown will queue the channel for adding to the current playlist.
* Channels can be manually entered into the queue fields and added.

Usage:
1. Type a channel name and "abbreviation" into text fields, then click the "Add" button (the return key in either field will also complete this action). Abbreviation refers to the string within the di.fm URL.
	Ex.) Name = Abbreviation: 
		Ambient = ambient
		Bass & Jackin' House = bassnjackinhouse
		Oldschool Techno & Trance = classictechno
2. Entries will be added to the TStringGrid. If at any point, an error is made, entries are editable similar to a spreadsheet application. The entire list can be cleared via the "Reset List" button.
3. Enter your "listen key" found in http://www.di.fm/settings into the Listen Key field.
4. Select either the "Server" or "Playlist" URL type. Server-side playlists are pre-configured with 2 to 8 station URLs. Server-type URLs simply remove this layer of redirection and access the station URLs directly.
5. Select any number of bandwidths for the Account type. Note: This is a global setting, so all stations you wish to write to the final m3u playlist will have their own sets of bandwidth entries. Bandwidths are not yet configurable per station.
6. If the Server URL type is selected, all eight redundant servers will be made available, of which any combination can be selected to be written into the playlist. Like bandwidths, servers are global. The m3u playlist will be written with the full list of selected stations under each channel.
   Warning: If all bandwidths and all stations are selected, each channel will host 32 separate entries in the m3u playlist. With 91 current channels, this is a maximum of approx. 2900 entries in said playlist file.
7. Click the "Save" or "Save As" button to collate all form data including entries in the Grid to the right-hand memo, then save its contents to a user-named m3u file.
8. Click "Play with Default Player" to run the saved m3u file in your computer's default media player.

Additional notes:
* Clicking "Play with Default Player" will play the last-saved playlist.
* Clicking "Play with Default Player" without saving the playlist will create a temporary playlist located in the User Local Temp folder (http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/XE3/en/System.IOUtils.TPath.GetTempPath).
* Clicking "Play with Default Player" without creating a playlist will check if any channel is currently queued, auto-add it to the playlist and create the temporary m3u to play. If no channel is even queued (the Edit fields are blank), an error will be displayed.
* As of April 2016, internet playlists are unavailable for free accounts - free accounts can only play from the browser. Therefore the "Free/Premium" radio buttons are greyed out and we always assume we're building a premium-type playlist.

Todo:
* Name all form elements for ease of future development.
* Re-order URL Option/Account boxes with bandwidth checkboxes - entering a listen key should be immediately followed by selection of Account type and URL Option, as both bandwidth and server-list visibility is toggled by said controls.
* Eventually remove/hide Memo1, as it is for debugging the string building functions only, and not of any use when generating the actual file.

Longterm:
* Scrobbling to LastFM would be extremely cool. Right now, the only scrobbler I know of that does this from an Internet radio station is a Foobar2000 plugin. Nothing exists afaik for WMP, Winamp, iTunes, etc.
* Media player controls would also be fun to do. Be able to control playback of a channel within the default media player via some method of writing a single station to a temporary playlist, then opening via a shell command (much simpler than figuring out the command-line API of each player and playing the URL directly, which, admittedly would be preferred).
